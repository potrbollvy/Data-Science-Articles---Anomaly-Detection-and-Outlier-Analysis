\Abstract{ 
Data analysis tools and techniques work in conjunction with collected data. The type of data that needs to be collected to carry out such analyses, as well as the priority placed on the collection of quality data relative to other demands, dictate the choice of data collection strategies. The manner in which the resulting outputs of these analyses are used for decision support will, in turn, influence appropriate data presentation strategies and system functionality. In this report, we present a brief overview of sampling methods, automated data collection, and web scraping.\par\smallskip \
