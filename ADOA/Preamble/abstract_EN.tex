\Abstract{ 
With the advent of automatic data collection, it now possible to store and process large troves of data. There are issues related to massive data sets, such as speed and efficiency of analytical methods, including the detection of anomalous observations and nalysis of outliers. \par\smallskip Extreme and irregular values behave very differently from the majority of observations. For instance, they can represent criminal attacks, fraud attempts, targeted attacks, or data collection errors. As a result, anomaly detection and outlier analysis play a crucial role en cybersecurity, quality control, etc. \cite{A1,A2,A3}. The (potentially) heavy human price and technical consequences related to the presence of such observations go a long way towards explaining why the topic has attracted attention in recent years. \par\smallskip
This rapport contains a review of various detection methods as well as a comparative analysis of algorithms when it comes to performance and limitations, illustrated with the help of a few practical examples, with particular attention paid to supervised and unsupervised methods.\par\smallskip \
